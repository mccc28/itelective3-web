## MEVN
The acronym **MEVN** stands for ***M***ongoDB, ***E***xpress.js, ***V***ueJS, ***N***ode.js.

MEVN stack is the open-source JavaScript software stack that has emerged as a new and evolving way to build powerful and dynamic web applications. Its software components can be used to effectively design frontend and backend development and improve the functionality of your website or app.

* **ExpressJS**: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was primarily developed to run JavaScript on a machine instead of making websites, ExpressJS was created for the latter purpose.
